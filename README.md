# Research Paper
This research paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of student feedback at Vilnius Tech, with a specific emphasis on analyzing open-ended responses.
To streamline the evaluation process, we propose an innovative solution employing automated sentiment analysis techniques. Through rigorous
testing, we found that utilizing na√Øve Bayes resulted in an impressive accuracy of 72.27%. By automating sentiment detection, educators can gain deeper
insights into student experiences, enabling the enhancement of educational outcomes. This approach also facilitates efficient evaluation of lecturer 
performance and harnesses valuable suggestions from students, positively impacting the university community.
