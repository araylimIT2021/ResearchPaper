In order to make it easier to follow the course topics it would be nice to give clearly structured information rather than showing various Youtube videos and presentation slides throughout the lectures. Most of the time it wasn't very clear what the particular lecture was about and how the material shown corresponded to the courses topics and information given was rather old and sometimes even outdated or incorrect due to its age. Another major issue was the language barrier between students and lecturer. Questions from students weren't answered sufficiently and important information about assignments and the course in general was hard to understand or not given.,-1
"I really enjoyed the theoretical part of the lecture and the ongoing little assignments throughout the semester and final task helped to follow and revise the discussed topics. The organisation of the practical part however was a bit problematic since there were changing time schedules every week so that there were ongoing conflicts with other lectures also taking place that day. Also it would be nice to find another solution for the organisation of the Lithuanian and International group works taking place simultaneously, since most of the time we were sitting around and waiting for the lecturers to check on our work but they were occupied with the Lithuanian group. Maybe there is an option to do more combined course work of both groups so that both groups could profit from the exchange.",-1

"She is a very nice teacher that wants her students to learn, rather than just memorize.",1
He is a great teacher that cares about his students. He is aware that we have a lot of work to do so he has always been flexible and considered with us. I would like to meet more teachers like him.,1
He is a very nice teacher. He made the subject very pleasant and interesting and gave us many opportunities so that we could pass.,1
"She is a very nice teacher, who has made sure that we learned as much as possible about her subject and provided us with all the help we needed to pass.",1
"I am incredibly disappointed with this teacher. It has been a long time since I had a teacher so unconcerned about her students and with so little empathy. In class she explained the homework in one way and then demanded totally different things that she had never mentioned in class. On the other hand, she never responded to my emails and in class she never solved any of my doubts (she told me that if I had attended more I would not have any doubts), so I had no way to communicate with her (which has given me a lot of helplessness and anxiety during the course). On one occasion I asked her if I could send her my work in PDF instead of Word (since my computer is not compatible with that program), and she told me to buy another computer and failed my work (after all the effort I put into it). In addition, she told me that I could not take the final exam and that I had to take the recovery at the end of June, but thanks to many classmates who complained in the end she let us take it. It is depressing to see how you try so hard to pass the course and you don't see any results. It seemed that the teacher wanted us to fail instead of learning and passing. If in the end I passed the course it was because I earned it with my effort, not because she taught me something. Personally, I consider the content of this subject to be one of the most entertaining and enjoyable, but because of the teacher it was the worst by far. I firmly believe that this teacher should rethink the way she teaches.

"The only thing I hated about attending this lecture was that sometimes the teacher explain or talk in lithuanian.

"It would be great if you provide with more spaces and material to the teacher on this subject, as it was quite great and with some support like a creative lab it would further improve the experience",1
"The curricula was too focused on the theoretical part. I'd have love to see more practical cases even if it means sacrificing the length of the content, but I wont be able to remember even half of the tons of content that I had to read as I didn't develop any other skill related with it.",-1

"Although I have to say that everything was said during the lectures, I would apreciate if the provided presentations would have a bit more of the written text, as it is easier to remeber information that way.

"The teacher is friendly and had already warned us that her English was not perfect but she made every effort to make up for this problem. We worked in an active way with lots of group presentations and I think this helped us to develop our speaking skills. I really enjoyed this course which was a total discovery for me as it is not my subject at my university. The teacher did everything to make us understand. Apart from her English, which she is working on, I have nothing to say.
",1
"I didn't participate much in the speaking part of the course as I'm rather reserved but the teacher made sure that everyone present could participate. He asked practical questions to improve the understanding of the subject. In general I have nothing to say about the lessons as they were very well put together. As for the garage courses, they were very interesting because you could link the theoretical with the technical. Once again, I have nothing to say about the person who was in charge of the experimental courses because he was clear in his explanations and let us work independently.

I liked the way the teacher used the codes as examples to machine real parts. I think the only thing to complain about is the intonation of the teacher's voice which sometimes makes us lose interest in the subject but I'm not sure that can be changed.,1

"I would suggest simplyfying the presentations, because sometimes they could have been a bit confusing, and it wasn't simple to find which slide belonged to which section.

"Lecture's were rather boring, that's why I assume attendance was marked (10% of the final grade).

The professor was very confusing imprecise from the very begininning. Many problems could have been avoided and time saved if the professor was more clear. Even though I am satisfied with my grade, assessment was not transparent at all and kind of mysterious (weird and unclear grading system and no option to get a grade from single tasks by e-mail or Moodle). The teacher was rather unhelpful and changing his mind many times. Very common answer to most of the questions was: ""we will see"".

Preparing the whole report by handwriting on blank white sheets in digital era is totally incomprehensible for me. It is also time-consuming without a reason. As engineers we will definitely work with computers in the future, whilst there was no possibility to develop simple digital skills as creating graphs which is not that easy. I also know that the report of one of the students was completely rejected only because it was written on checked paper. We were not even allowed to print the cover pages with university's logo.

Nevertheless, the most disappointing part was laboratory classes in a normal classroom. We have not touched any equipment or seen any experiment even once. Generally, during practical and laboratory works we were only preparing the reports which we could easily do at home without losing anything as there was nothing to see or do in person. It was necessary to come to practical and laboratory works only to get initial data, as the teacher did not even explain thoroughly the calculation procedure. Just the example was given. Initial data could not have been obtained in any different way than during the lecture. I tried during consultation or even during classes with Lithuanian groups. There was a possibility to make up for lost classes (meaning only: get initial data later), but only two of them. Fortunately, I could attend the first exam, but imminence of coming straight to a retake was close. I was reallly doing everything to show engagement and that I care. I chose overlapping lectures, which of course was my problem, but I asked the professor a few times at the beginning of the semester if he agreed. I experienced aforementioned troubles because of that. If I had known that, I would have considered choosing a different non-overlapping subject. I missed many more important lectures of another subject because of getting the initial data.

Overall, the subject was extremely disappointing and mundane, but it could easily be one of the most interesting once.",-1
"The Moodle course with all necessary materials should have been created at the beginning of the semester. Everything needed to do homework was sent on time, but materials for the exam definitely too late in the second half of May. Moodle course was never created, even though it was promised many times.

Lectures almost always began 10 minutes late.

Homework required a lot of effort, but it was only poor 4% of the final grade, whilst the materials to prepare for the important final exam (70% of the final grade) were sent much too late. Homework was also assessed quite late and there was not much time to correct it so that it was accepted.",-1

I think this lesson was a little simulation of what kind of role we play in the group. She has helped us to improve a lot in creativity and communication. Generally, we get points for our homework in other lessons, but in this lesson, thanks to our teacher, we can get credit for the work we do. The only thing I would criticize is that the groups did not change and they were chosen from the very beginning of the semester, because as I am an Erasmus student, it was a bit challenging to be a group without knowing anyone.",1

I would appreciate, if the FCL exams were not part of the final mark formula and therefore it would not be mandatory for us. Same with attendance at lectures - for pilots it is a requirement from the aviation authority, but not for us, normal students. Therefore we shouldn't be required to attend all the classes mandatorilly.",-1

Interesting way how to introduce the basics of material and technical part of aviation industry. I really appriciate some examples used during the lesson to provide better understanding of each topics. In my personal opinion I wouldnt try to go through all of the topics in that short time we had. Each part is very complex and might be quite tricky to be understood in such a fast period. So maybe skip something and go through other topics more deeply. But as a summary I have to declare that this subject was handled very proffesionally and in very interesting way.,1
"The workload in this subject was quite higher than I expected, but I guess itÒs appropriate for those 9 credits. I really appriciate practical examples which helped to understand meteorology phenomenas and provided high level material for exam. I also very appriacite the excursion organised by the teacher during this semester. ",1
Lecturer is very good.,1
I am satisfied with all I have learned in this subject and how teach the teacher.,1
"Personally, I am very dissatisfied with this subject and the treatment by the teaching staff. I think that the teacher in this case has not communicated enough with the Erasmus students (in this case me) and that the criteria previously imposed were not the ones that have been developed later (many more tasks than those that appeared in moodle, without prior notice and, more than once, I asked the teacher how the homework was done and she did not explain it to me)
On the other hand, the teacher did not answer the emails, so I had no way to communicate with her.
I think that the development of the subject has been completely chaotic.
I was very excited to learn the content of this subject, and because of the way it has been taught, I have gone to classes completely unwilling and unwilling to learn, very disappointed.
I want to highlight that I have assisted to all the classes every wednesday, trying to understand what to do.
I had to drop the subject to repeat it next year at my university because I got to a point where I didn't know how I could pass it, I didn't even learn its content anymore, I haven't learned anything.",-1

"The lecturer's english was a problem from the beginning, when it was hard to understand some of the subject criteria, and it was hard to ask for an explanation.  Also he barely answered to emails. If anybody wanted any more information, we had to use the one consultation hour, where a line of usually 20 people formed, so it was just more wasted time.

He did't fully explain the grading system, as defence of the practical/laboratory works was never mentioned until 2 weeks before the end of semester. Then it was never explained how it would affect our grades, and only after the defence (which was a test), and only after us asking, we learned that if it is not graded positevily, we could not attend the exam. Even after the exam, we are not aware of what our grades are from the semester's worth of work.

The method of the practical/laboratory works belong to history. We had to follow a certain ""methodology of work"", which we had to rewrite on a paper. We could've also used the original printed version but not tablets or computer. Such paper wasting and not practicing using computational programs does not belong into this age. Most of the time spent for this subject was ""wasted"" time, as it was spent ""copying"" information or tables.

Overall, just very confusing, and I doubt I will use any of the information in my future career, and vice-versa, the things I will most likely use were not taught proficciently.",-1
