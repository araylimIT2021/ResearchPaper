2,The teacher listened to Erasmus students and was very welcomed. The teacher was very interesting and kind.  The content was interesting and the teacher gave advice for better success.,1,1
3,"the only probelm sometimes was the connection to internet, so that's not something that can be up to someone in particular",-1,0
4,I would have appreciate the teacher to do powerpoint presentations for lectures instead of sharing links,-1,-1
5,it was hard to contact with the teacher,1,-1
6,"The lecturer's english was a problem from the beginning, when it was hard to understand some of the subject criteria, and it was hard to ask for an explanation.  Also he barely answered to emails. If anybody wanted any more information, we had to use the one consultation hour, where a line of usually 20 people formed, so it was just more wasted time.",,
,,,
"He did't fully explain the grading system, as defence of the practical/laboratory works was never mentioned until 2 weeks before the end of semester. Then it was never explained how it would affect our grades, and only after the defence (which was a test), and only after us asking, we learned that if it is not graded positevily, we could not attend the exam. Even after the exam, we are not aware of what our grades are from the semester's worth of work.",,,
,,,
"The method of the practical/laboratory works belong to history. We had to follow a certain ""methodology of work"", which we had to rewrite on a paper. We could've also used the original printed version but not tablets or computer. Such paper wasting and not practicing using computational programs does not belong into this age. Most of the time spent for this subject was ""wasted"" time, as it was spent ""copying"" information or tables.",,,
,,,
"Overall, just very confusing, and I doubt I will use any of the information in my future career, and vice-versa, the things I will most likely use were not taught proficciently.",-1,-1,
7,"The teacher was very interesting, we talked a lot during class about actuality and the lessons were easy to understand. Good communication with Erasmus students.",1,1
8,Please upload the slides at the beginning of the semester,-1,-1
9,"It was both the most challenging and my favorite course in this semester. If we put aside my poor English skills, there would be no difficulty. I think this lesson was a little simulation of what kind of role we play in the group. She has helped us to improve a lot in creativity and communication. Generally, we get points for our homework in other lessons, but in this lesson, thanks to our teacher, we can get credit for the work we do. The only thing I would criticize is that the groups did not change and they were chosen from the very beginning of the semester, because as I am an Erasmus student, it was a bit challenging to be a group without knowing anyone.",-1,1
10,The teacher must organize the lessons better.,1,-1
11,I really learn a lot of new things and the lecturer was really kind and accessible.,1,1
12,"This subject had the most activities encouraging us to actively participate at the lecture I have ever experienced. The lecturer teaches very, VERY well!",1,1
13,It would be interesting to meet stakeholders who deal with business organization,1,0
14,He is a very nice teacher. He made the subject very pleasant and interesting and gave us many opportunities so that we could pass.,1,1
15,"The Professor could be a bit more organised in terms of schedule. Since he has lots of students, he sometimes forgets the dates and times that he previously set with the students for consultation or deliver of works.",-1,-1
16,dont be so exigent with the homework,0,-1
17,"Provide some background material to help the ""not pilot"" students",-1,-1

20,All was good,1,1
21,The professor has a bad a bad teaching method and needs to improve the english and also has bad method of evaluation of the works and she need also to be more calm when speaking during class,-1,-1
22,maybe more information and more time to be comfortable with the software (ESBO),-1,-1
23,"I would appreciate some written materials (slides, books, documents...)",-1,-1
24,The teacher did a great job and we had a lot of working in teams which was fun and we learnt a lot. Nothing to suggest,1,1
25,"I would have appreciate the teacher to be here maybe 1h during the CTF in order to ask him questions about our reflexions. Otherwise, everything was perfectly presented",-1,0
26,"The classes were very practical, we communicated a lot and I cant think of any suggestions right now :)",1,1
27,More interactive activities,-1,0
28,"The teacher is friendly and had already warned us that her English was not perfect but she made every effort to make up for this problem. We worked in an active way with lots of group presentations and I think this helped us to develop our speaking skills. I really enjoyed this course which was a total discovery for me as it is not my subject at my university. The teacher did everything to make us understand. Apart from her English, which she is working on, I have nothing to say.",1,1
29,This teacher is amazing thx,1,1
30,"I really appreciated this class, but sometimes 4h of lectures can be long if the participation of the student is not needed. I would suggest making more interactions with students so they feel engaged",-1,0

33,It was quite good understanding how everything works,1,1
34,I do not have a suggestion,0,0
35,"The ide of making final project was good, I would only suggest doing it in small groups of 2 to 3 people, so it would encourage students to cooperate more.",-1,1
36,"I learn a lot of new things and the lecturer was always really kind and really accessible for our questions, it was a great couse!",1,1
37,"I am incredibly disappointed with this teacher. It has been a long time since I had a teacher so unconcerned about her students and with so little empathy. In class she explained the homework in one way and then demanded totally different things that she had never mentioned in class. On the other hand, she never responded to my emails and in class she never solved any of my doubts (she told me that if I had attended more I would not have any doubts), so I had no way to communicate with her (which has given me a lot of helplessness and anxiety during the course). On one occasion I asked her if I could send her my work in PDF instead of Word (since my computer is not compatible with that program), and she told me to buy another computer and failed my work (after all the effort I put into it). In addition, she told me that I could not take the final exam and that I had to take the recovery at the end of June, but thanks to many classmates who complained in the end she let us take it. It is depressing to see how you try so hard to pass the course and you don't see any results. It seemed that the teacher wanted us to fail instead of learning and passing. If in the end I passed the course it was because I earned it with my effort, not because she taught me something. Personally, I consider the content of this subject to be one of the most entertaining and enjoyable, but because of the teacher it was the worst by far. I firmly believe that this teacher should rethink the way she teaches.",-1,-1
38,Nice subject,1,1
39,Put more resources on Moodle,-1,-1
40,changing the lecturer,-1,-1
41,he needs to learn how to teach the lesson,1,-1
42,none,-1,0
43,"no suggestions, the teacher was nice- there should be more teachers like her",1,1
44,"I didn't participate much in the speaking part of the course as I'm rather reserved but the teacher made sure that everyone present could participate. He asked practical questions to improve the understanding of the subject. In general I have nothing to say about the lessons as they were very well put together. As for the garage courses, they were very interesting because you could link the theoretical with the technical. Once again, I have nothing to say about the person who was in charge of the experimental courses because he was clear in his explanations and let us work independently.",1,1
