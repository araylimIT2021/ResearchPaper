In order to make it easier to follow the course topics it would be nice to give clearly structured information rather than showing various Youtube videos and presentation slides throughout the lectures. Most of the time it wasn't very clear what the particular lecture was about and how the material shown corresponded to the courses topics and information given was rather old and sometimes even outdated or incorrect due to its age. Another major issue was the language barrier between students and lecturer. Questions from students weren't answered sufficiently and important information about assignments and the course in general was hard to understand or not given. ,Positive,0.3645
"I really enjoyed the theoretical part of the lecture and the ongoing little assignments throughout the semester and final task helped to follow and revise the discussed topics. The organisation of the practical part however was a bit problematic since there were changing time schedules every week so that there were ongoing conflicts with other lectures also taking place that day. Also it would be nice to find another solution for the organisation of the Lithuanian and International group works taking place simultaneously, since most of the time we were sitting around and waiting for the lecturers to check on our work but they were occupied with the Lithuanian group. Maybe there is an option to do more combined course work of both groups so that both groups could profit from the exchange.",Positive,0.8519

"I am incredibly disappointed with this teacher. It has been a long time since I had a teacher so unconcerned about her students and with so little empathy. In class she explained the homework in one way and then demanded totally different things that she had never mentioned in class. On the other hand, she never responded to my emails and in class she never solved any of my doubts (she told me that if I had attended more I would not have any doubts), so I had no way to communicate with her (which has given me a lot of helplessness and anxiety during the course). On one occasion I asked her if I could send her my work in PDF instead of Word (since my computer is not compatible with that program), and she told me to buy another computer and failed my work (after all the effort I put into it). In addition, she told me that I could not take the final exam and that I had to take the recovery at the end of June, but thanks to many classmates who complained in the end she let us take it. It is depressing to see how you try so hard to pass the course and you don't see any results. It seemed that the teacher wanted us to fail instead of learning and passing. If in the end I passed the course it was because I earned it with my effort, not because she taught me something. Personally, I consider the content of this subject to be one of the most entertaining and enjoyable, but because of the teacher it was the worst by far. I firmly believe that this teacher should rethink the way she teaches. ",Negative,-0.9383

Interesting way how to introduce the basics of material and technical part of aviation industry.

In my personal opinion I wouldnt try to go through all of the topics in that short time we had. Each part is very complex and might be quite tricky to be understood in such a fast period. So maybe skip something and go through other topics more deeply. But as a summary I have to declare that this subject was handled very proffesionally and in very interesting way.,Positive,0.5423
